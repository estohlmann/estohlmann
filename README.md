# Hey there! 👋

Welcome to my corner of the internet. Pull up a chair, grab some ☕ (or your beverage of choice), and let's get to know each other.

## Who am I?

I'm **Evan** — Senior Software Development Engineer at Amazon 🏢, open-source enthusiast 🚀, and someone who genuinely believes that good code and good coffee make the world a better place.

## What I'm up to now 🛠️

Since November 2023 I've been at **Amazon**, where I'm leading two open-source projects: one focused on [**distributed AIML/data science platforms**](https://github.com/awslabs/MLSpace) and another on [**LLM hosting platforms**](https://github.com/awslabs/LISA). The goal? Help AWS customers in closed networks get their hands on free, cutting-edge software, to meet their business needs. I'm also all-in on team development and efficient software delivery — because shipping impactful stuff is what gets me out of bed (that and my three crazy kids).

## Where I've been 🌱

Before Amazon, I was **Lead Developer at Milli Bank** (June 2020 – November 2023), where I led multiple teams in a startup environment and helped set refined, modern standards and practices. Over the last **10+ years** I've been a **Full Stack Developer** with a focus on **API and microservice development** — and I've spent a lot of that time **mentoring** new developers. Seeing people level up and advance their careers is one of my favorite parts of the job. 💪

## Teaching & mentoring 🎓

Since 2022 I've been **Lead Instructor at Metropolitan Community College's Code School**. I bring real-world experience into the classroom and guide students through full stack development — basically, I get to help grow the next generation of developers. If you've ever wanted to turn "how does this even work?!" into "oh, I built that," that's the energy I'm going for. 📚✨

## The academic side 🎓

- **Bachelor's** in Computer Engineering and Mathematics — **UNL** (2016)  
- **Master's** in Computer Science (Interactive Intelligence) — **Georgia Tech** (2018)  

So yes, I like school *and* building things. Best of both worlds.

## Let's connect 🤝

Feel free to poke around my repos, open an issue, or just say hi. I'm always up for a good tech conversation, mentoring chat, or bad pun about code.

*Thanks for stopping by — and remember: the best code is the code that ships.* 🚢
